<p> I am Zachary Townsend, as you can see from the header, I go by Zac. Here is a picture for you to to put a face to the name on the right. I took that picture in December, 2017 using the self-timer function on my Iphone because none of my friends were still in town.</p>
<p> One of the main things about me is that I am a die hard Georgia football fan. Since 2007, I have been to at least 1 home game a year. Since 2012, my dad and I have had season tickets so we have been to more than one game each year.<br><br> UGA football rules my world the 6 months its in season and the 6 months that is not in season. The love I have for Georgia Football led me to choose the major sports management. Sports management at UGA was what I chose because of the possiblity to work for UGA sports while in school. For example, here are the separate sports for men and women at UGA.
<H2>Women's Sports</H2>

<li>Basketball</li>
<li>Cross Country</li>

<li>Swimming & Diving</li>

<li>Volleyball</li>
</ul>
